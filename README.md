# Investigating Netflix movies
This project really showcases my skills in data exploration using Python. 

# Objectives

Netflix has grown from a DVD rental service in 1997 to a major entertainment hub. There's a belief that the average length of movies on Netflix is decreasing. 
My goal is to investigate this using data, confirming if movies are indeed getting shorter over time. 
I also explore why this might be happening by looking at factors like genres, duration, and Movies release over year. 
The study aims to give a clear picture of how movie durations are changing on Netflix and why.
